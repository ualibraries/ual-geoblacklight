      "The REOA model approach used to generate this dataset incorporates two main objectives (physical and economic) and a range of sub-objectives to determine suitability. Objectives and sub-objectives are given weights based on the relative importance to each other. The physical objective was the aspect of the land surface, while the economic objectives consisted of proximity to existing roads, railroads, transmission lines, and sub-stations. For each objective and sub-objective a unique model was created in ArcGIS Model Builder that incorporated various tools from the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst Extension for ArcMap. This dataset is not a final assessment of the real-world suitability of a given area of land and must be ground-truthed. Full explanation of methodology can be found here:https://rurallandscapes.extension.arizona.edu/sites/rurallandscapes.extension.arizona.edu/files/resources/Project%20Overview%20for%20REOA%20.pdf\" Summary of Model REOA-Modeling Notes -Model Extent: South (Pima, Santa Cruz, Cochise); West (Yuma, La Paz, Mohave); Central (Maricopa, Pinal, Gila); North Central (Yavapai, Coconino); North East (Navajo, Apache); East Central (Graham, Greenlee) -Raster Cell Size: 0.0025 acres (~33 x 33 feet) or (10 x 10 m) -Model Mask (i.e. Absolute physical constraints for solar siting capability) >National Park Service lands, US Forest Service lands, AZ State parks and; monuments, all wilderness and conservation areas. >All streams classified by ALRIS with 600' total width buffer from centerline of streams and 1000' total width buffer from the centerline of the San Pedro and Santa Cruz Rivers >Lakes: A 500' buffer around lakes will be employed >Slope: All lands with slope greater than 4% (areas with 2% or less slope = high suitability, 2.01 - 3% slope = moderate suitability, and 3.01 – 4% slope = low suitability). >Solar insolation (7 kw or greater).

Physical Suitability – (Weight: .25) -Areas with S, SE, SW, and flat aspects as highest potential, all other aspects as lowest potential (Weight: .5) -Areas with slope 4% or less (areas with 2% or less slope = high suitability, 2.01 – 3% slope = moderate suitability, and 3.01 to 4% slope = low suitability) (Weight: .5) 2. Economic Suitability – (Weight: .75) -Identify lands proximal to transmission lines (within 300’ of 115 kV or greater = high suitability, 300’ – 1000’ = moderate suitability, and greater than 1000’ = low suitability) (Weight: .35) -Identify lands proximal to sub-stations (Weight: .35) -Identify lands proximal to roads (Weight: .2) -Identify lands proximal to railroads (Weight: .1)"
